Stat 331 Final, Winter Quarter 2022 

## Contribution Steps
Here are some steps for contributing changes to this repository:
1. Clone the repository with `git clone` or any Git client
2. Create a new branch and switch to it with `git checkout -b {branchname}` (the `-b` argument creates a new branch, `checkout` switches to it)
3. Make sick changes.
4. Stage those changes for commit with `git status` -> `git add {files}`, or manually stage files in a Git client
5. Commit those changes with `git commit -m "{what you did}`
6. `git push` or push changes with Git client
7. Let Nick know about the changes so he can create a pull request and merge the changes in (or do it yourself if you're brave!)

## Other Git tips
1. Make sure to `git fetch` or `git pull` frequently
2. If you want to merge the updated changes from the main branch into your current branch, you can use `git merge main`
3. If things start going horribly wrong, ask!
